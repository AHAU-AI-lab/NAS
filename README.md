# Content
Notebooks:
1.NAS.ipynb
Example of how to use the NAS library.
2.transfer.ipynb:
Example of how to use the Tran_NAS library.Notebook explaining step by step how to reproduce the results reported in our work. Here, the code is only executed for tansfer datasets.
# Data:
The NAS methods have been used datasets and these are all provided here in the folder five type of data.rar
The Tran_NAS methods have been used datasets and these are all provided here in the folder transfer data.rar
# Dependencies:
If you are just interested in using ghostml in your own code/notebooks, you'll just need these packages:

numpy
